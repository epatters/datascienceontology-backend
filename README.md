# Backend for Data Science Ontology

This repository contains the web backend for the Data Science Ontology,
consisting of:
- REST API, implemented using an Express.js proxy server
- CouchDB (or Cloudant) database
- Actions for Apache OpenWhisk (or IBM Cloud Functions)

The Data Science Ontology itself lives in its own
[repository](https://github.com/ibm/datascienceontology).
