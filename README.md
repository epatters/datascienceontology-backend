# Data Science Ontology backend

The Data Science Ontology backend consists of
- REST API, implemented by Express.js proxy server
- CouchDB (or Cloudant) database
- Actions for Apache OpenWhisk (or IBM Cloud Functions)

The ontology itself lives in [its own repository](https://bitbucket.org/opendiscovery/data-science-ontology).
